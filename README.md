My solutions to the 2023 Advent of Code made with Typescript. 

You can run a solution with e.g. `npx ts-node path/to/solution.ts path/to/data.txt` (after running `npm i`), though any way to execute typescript probably works, as long as path to the input data in text file format is given as an argument after the path to the solution file. 

I opted not to make any kind of a build process due to it not being necessary for this case. 

All solutions run in human-viable time on my inputs and machine (5800X3D, 32GB RAM). Most solutions complete under 1 second, but solutions for days 12, 23, and possibly 25 (depending on luck) take longer.
